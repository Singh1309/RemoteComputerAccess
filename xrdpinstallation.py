To install xrdp on Ubuntu, you will need to have administrator privileges on the computer and have access to a terminal window. 
You can follow these steps to install xrdp on Ubuntu:
Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu computer.
'''

#Update the package index by running the following command:
sudo apt update
#Install xrdp and its dependencies by running the following command:
sudo apt install xrdp
#Once the installation is complete, start the xrdp service by running the following command:
sudo service xrdp start
#To enable xrdp to start automatically when the computer is booted, run the following command:
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
#To verify that xrdp is running and listening on the default port (3389), run the following command:
sudo netstat -antp | grep xrdp

'''
If xrdp is running and listening on the default port, you should see output similar to this:
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3389            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1234/xrdp

If xrdp is running and listening on the default port, you can now connect to the Ubuntu computer using an RDP client, such as the built-in Remote Desktop Connection tool on Windows or the Remote Desktop App on Mac.
If you encounter any errors or problems during the installation process, you can refer to the xrdp documentation or seek help from the xrdp community.
